        <!-- introduction -->
        <p>Most humans spend more than 40% of their waking life on the
        internet, using it for all kinds of tasks—even private ones,
        like talking to our friends. How can I make sure to keep my
        conversations private ? A good answer is <strong>end-to-end
        encryption</strong>. Let’s dive into the topic, and why we need
        such a thing.</p>
        <h2 id="the-early-internet-web-1.0">The early internet (web
        1.0)</h2>
        <p>Let’s first have a quick look of internet history. At first,
        the internet was a friendly place and most communications
        happened in clear.</p>

        <p>But then hackers came, they were able to listen to our
        communication or even do powerful tricks such as <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">man-in-the-middle
        attacks</a>, allowing them to intercept, block and inject
        messages, impersoning Alice or Bob. Internet was no longer a
        safe place.</p>

        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">web1b</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>But internet is full of wizards! They soon had developed
        cryptographic protocols such as <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">SSH</a>, <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">SSL/TLS</a>
        and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP</a>,
        allowing them to be much safer against such attackers.
        Everything was fine again.</p>

        <h2 id="the-age-of-platforms-web-2.0">The age of platforms (web
        2.0)</h2>
        <p>But then, Muggles (people that did not knew how the internet
        worked) cames. Because they were not wizard, they were not able
        to host their own website (even more so email servers). Yet they
        needed to communicate. They had to uses <em>platforms</em>. This
        is what we call the web 2.0.</p>
        <figure>
        <img src="web2.svg" alt="web2" />
        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">web2</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Shortly after the rise of the web 2.0, most of our private
        communications happens on platforms like Gmail or Whatsapp, most
        of our though are shared on Twitter or Reddit, and most of our
        value is exchanged on platforms such as Amazon or Uber.</p>
        <p>Platforms are wonderful, they help people connect and let the
        economy grow. They even protect our communication. We hear
        Google’s <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil">“Don’t be
        evil”</a> and there is some “privacy lays” such as the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>.
        But we also entered the world of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">Surveillance
        capitalism</a> and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_broker">data
        brokers</a> are selling our data.</p>
        <h2 id="end-to-end-encryption">End-to-end encryption</h2>
        <p>Alice wants to talk to Bob using a platform. Instead of
        encrypting her message to the platform, she can encrypt her
        message to Bob. This is called <strong>end-to-end
        encryption</strong>, and it’s the way to hide your messages in
        the age of the platforms. The idea is simple: you encrypt your
        messages on <em>your device</em> and the messages are decrypted
        on your correspondent’s device. This way, the platform only sees
        the encrypted message, revaling no information about the
        cleartext.</p>

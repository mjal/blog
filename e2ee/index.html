        <!-- introduction -->
        <p>Most humans spend more than 40% of their waking life on the
        internet, using it for all kinds of tasks—even private ones.</p>
        <p>Let’s dive into how private internet things really are.</p>
        <!-- history -->
        <h2 id="the-early-internet-web-1.0">The early internet (web
        1.0)</h2>
        <p>Let’s first have a quick look of internet history. At first,
        the internet was a friendly place and most communications
        happened in clear.</p>
        <figure>

        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">web1a</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>But then hackers came, they were able to listen to our
        communication or even do powerful tricks such as <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">man-in-the-middle
        attacks (MITM)</a>, allowing them to intercept, block and inject
        messages, impersoning Alice or Bob. Internet was no longer a
        safe place.</p>
        <figure>
        <img src="web1b.svg" alt="web1b" />
        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">web1b</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>But internet was full of wizards. They soon had developed
        cryptographic protocols such as <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">SSH</a>, <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">SSL/TLS</a>
        and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP</a>,
        allowing them to be much safer against such attackers.</p>
        <figure>
        <img src="web1c.svg" alt="web1c" />
        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">web1c</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Everything was fine again.</p>
        <h2 id="the-age-of-platforms-web-2.0">The age of platforms (web
        2.0)</h2>
        <p>But then, Muggles (people that did not knew how the internet
        worked) cames. Because they were not wizard, they were not able
        to host their own website (even more so email servers). Yet they
        needed to communicate. They had to uses <em>platforms</em>. This
        is what we call the web 2.0.</p>
        <figure>
        <img src="web2.svg" alt="web2" />
        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">web2</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Shortly after the rise of the web 2.0, most of our private
        communications happens on platforms like Gmail or Whatsapp, most
        of our though are shared on Twitter or Reddit, and most of our
        value is exchanged on platforms such as Amazon or Uber.</p>
        <figure>

        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">age-of-platforms</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>And all of this is fine for a while. Platforms are wonderful,
        they help people connect and let the economy grow. They even
        protect our communication. We hear Google’s <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil">“Don’t be
        evil”</a> and there is some “privacy lays” such as the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>.
        But we also entered the world of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">Surveillance
        capitalism</a> and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_broker">data
        brokers</a> are everywhere.</p>
        <h2 id="end-to-end-encryption-1">End-to-end encryption</h2>
        <p>Alice wants to talk to Bob using a platform. Instead of
        encrypting her message to the platform, she can encrypt her
        message to Bob. This is called <strong>end-to-end
        encryption</strong>, and it’s the way to hide your messages in
        the age of the platforms. The idea is simple: you encrypt your
        messages on <em>your device</em> and the messages are decrypted
        on your correspondent’s device. This way, the platform only sees
        the encrypted message, revaling no information about the
        cleartext.</p>

        <!-- encryption -->
        <p>Privacy matters. To have privacy on the internet, we usually
        rely on encryption. Signal is one of the best tools out there
        for end-to-end encrypted communication. Yet encryption is not
        always enough. We also need to take good care of metadata.</p>
        <p>What is <strong>metadata</strong>? Metadata is the context of
        your message. From whom to whom, when, with what device, which
        app, etc.</p>
        <p>Metadata is very important. Some even said that “if you have
        enough metadata you don’t really need content”. Indeed, knowing
        who knows who is already valuable information, and can be enough
        to infer a lot of information, including political views or
        other sensitive information.</p>
        <p>Someone sitting in the same coffeeshop, sharing the same wifi
        hotspot and looking at network traffic (he is a tech enthusiast)
        wouldn’t be able to know more than “This person is using Signal
        (actively or not)”. Which you can argue is already sensitive
        information, it already tells something about Alice. For that,
        you can use a VPN (but they’re not silver bullets either).</p>
        <!-- Schema SVG de alice, mallory (with a deamon smiley, the wifi hotspot
        (internet smileys). You see Signal messages (the arrows become blue with a
        signal logo) going through the wifi hotspot, and we can see Mallory seeing them
        (also lighting up ?) -->
        <p>If you’re communicating with someone also sharing the same
        wifi hotspot, he would also be able to know “This person is
        probably communicating with that person”.</p>
        <!-- Same schema. But Bob also use Signal, and receive Alice messages (through
        the wifi hotspot and back). Mallory can see both, and can infer that Alice is
        probably talking to Bob. -->
        <!-- weak attacker knowledge

        He wouldn't be able to know more than "This person is using Signal actively or
        non-actively" (which is already a sensitive information). If you're
        communicating with someone also sharing the same wifi hotspot, he would also be
        able to know "This person is probably communicating with that person".

        This is already a lot. In fact, how often you use Signal says a lot about you,
        because it tells a lot about your friends. But for that, we want even more
        adoption, so it becomes the norm.

        -->
        <!-- strong attacker -->
        <p>But we also need to consider stronger attackers, including
        Signal themselve, the people hosting them (which would be Amazon
        in the case of Signal), people owning part of the internet
        infrastructure, or a even a collusion of such actors. We
        consider such powerful attacker in <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provable_security">provable
        security</a></p>
        <p>In the case of Signal, Message content’s privacy is proven in
        such strong model, but for metadata, we don’t really know.</p>
        <p>Such strong attacker can gain even more information either be
        passive observation (I see that when Alice is sending a message,
        Bob is receiving one). They can also actively interact to gain
        some information (If I block Bob, Alice is not receiving a read
        receipt).</p>
        <!-- Schema with DY attacker -->
        <p>Yet, Signal is still an essential tool that we should use as
        much as possible, but please remember that it’s not a silver
        bullet. Such metadata gathering could even transform Signal in
        the very mass surveillance machinery it tries to circumvent (the
        same argument can (loosely) be made for other encrypted
        messaging apps like Matrix or (even more strongly) for Telegram,
        Whatsapp…).</p>
